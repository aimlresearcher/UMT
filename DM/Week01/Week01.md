- Making quick decisions with incomplete data

**Solution Approaches:**  
- Real-time processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Kafka, Flink)  
- Online learning algorithms that update on-the-fly
## 📦 6. Data Objects and Attribute Types

In data mining, it's crucial to understand the types of data you’re working with, as this influences the choice of preprocessing techniques and mining algorithms.

---

### 🧱 6.1 Data Objects and Attributes  
- **Data Object (Instance or Tuple):**  
A data object represents a record or instance in a dataset.  
**Example:** A customer entry in a retail database (name, age, city, purchase amount).

- **Attributes (Features or Variables):**  
Attributes describe properties of a data object. Each attribute has a type, which determines how it can be processed.

---

### 🏷️ 6.2 Attribute Types

| **Type**   | **Description**                                                      | **Examples**                               |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Nominal** | Categorical values with no natural order                             | Gender (Male/Female), City                |
| **Ordinal** | Ordered categories with no fixed distance                           | Ratings (Low, Medium, High)               |
| **Interval** | Numeric values with meaningful distances, but no true zero          | Temperature in Celsius                    |

**Note:**  
- Use scaling and normalization techniques depending on attribute type.  
- **Nominal/Ordinal** = categorical encoding  
- **Interval/Ratio** = numerical preprocessing

---

### 🧾 6.3 Structured vs. Unstructured Data

| **Type**            | **Description**                                                  | **Examples**                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Structured Data**  | Organized in tables with rows and columns. Easy to query and analyze. | Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle)  |
| **Unstructured Data**| Does not follow a pre-defined format. Harder to analyze directly. | Text, images, audio, video, social media data |
