## 🧩 Part 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?

### 🧠 Definitions of AI

> “AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” – *John McCarthy*  
> “AI is the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.” – *Russell & Norvig*

### 📌 Four Approaches to AI

| 👤 Human-Based                  | 🧠 Rational-Based               |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Think like humans 🤔 (Cognitive modeling) | Think rationally 📐 (Laws of thought) |
| Act like humans 🧪 (Turing Test)          | Act rationally 🎯 (Rational Agent)    |

💡 **Activity Prompt**:  
*In pairs, come up with your own definition of AI and compare with a neighboring team.*
