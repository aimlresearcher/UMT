📘 Neural Networks – Basic Concepts
🔎 What is a Neural Network?
A Neural Network (NN) is a computational model inspired by the human brain’s structure and function.
It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and can learn complex patterns.

Neural Networks are a core technology behind Deep Learning, which powers modern AI applications like:

Image recognition

Speech recognition

Natural language processing (NLP)

Self-driving cars

🧠 Why Neural Networks?
Traditional algorithms struggle when:

The data has many variables (high-dimensional).

The patterns are complex and non-linear.

Neural Networks can:

Learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

Generalize well to new, unseen data.

That’s why they are widely used in classification, regression, and even reinforcement learning tasks.

⚙ Basic Structure of a Neural Network
A Neural Network has three main types of layers:

Layer Type	Description
Input Layer	Receives the input data (features).
Hidden Layer(s)	Processes data through neurons; can be multiple layers.
Output Layer	Produces the final prediction (label or value).

🏷 How Does a Neural Network Learn?
The learning process involves:

Forward Propagation

Data passes through the layers.

Each neuron applies a weight and activation function to its input.

Loss Calculation

The loss function measures the error between the prediction and the actual output.

Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)

The model adjusts the weights using gradient descent to reduce the error.

Iterations (Epochs)

Steps 1–3 are repeated many times until the model learns.

🧩 Key Components
Component	Role
Neuron	Basic unit that receives input, processes it, and passes output.
Weights	Multipliers that adjust the importance of each input.
Activation Function	Decides whether a neuron should activate (introduces non-linearity). Common functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh.
Loss Function	Measures how well the model is performing.
Optimizer	Algorithm (like Gradient Descent) that updates the weights to minimize loss.

📊 Example: Image Classification with Neural Networks
Input	Output
Image pixels (features)	Label: Cat or Dog

The NN processes the pixel data through layers and predicts whether the image contains a cat or a dog.
