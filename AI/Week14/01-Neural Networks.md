# 📘 Neural Networks – Basic Concepts

## 🔎 What is a Neural Network?

A **Neural Network (NN)** is a computational model inspired by the **human brain’s structure and function**.  
It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (**neurons**) that process data and learn complex patterns.

Neural Networks are the **core technology behind Deep Learning**, powering modern AI applications like:

- 🖼 **Image recognition**
- 🗣 **Speech recognition**
- 📝 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- 🚗 **Self-driving cars**

## 🧠 Why Neural Networks?

Traditional algorithms struggle when:

- 📊 The data has many variables (**high-dimensional**).
- 🔄 The patterns are **complex and non-linear**.

**Neural Networks can**:

- 🧩 Learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
- 🌱 Generalize well to new, unseen data.

That’s why they are widely used in **classification, regression,** and even **reinforcement learning** tasks.

## ⚙ Basic Structure of a Neural Network

A Neural Network has three main types of layers:

| Layer Type      | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Input Layer**     | Receives the input data (features).            |
| **Hidden Layer(s)** | Processes data through neurons; can be multiple layers. |
| **Output Layer**    | Produces the final prediction (label or value). |

## 🏷 How Does a Neural Network Learn?

The learning process involves:

1. 🔄 **Forward Propagation**  
   - Data passes through the layers.
   - Each neuron applies a weight and activation function to its input.

2. 📉 **Loss Calculation**  
   - The **loss function** measures the error between the prediction and the actual output.

3. 🔁 **Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)**  
   - The model adjusts the weights using **gradient descent** to reduce the error.

4. 🔄 **Iterations (Epochs)**  
   - Steps 1–3 are repeated many times until the model learns.

## 🧩 Key Components

| Component         | Role                                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Neuron**            | Basic unit that receives input, processes it, and passes output.       |
| **Weights**           | Multipliers that adjust the importance of each input.                  |
| **Activation Function** | Decides whether a neuron should activate (introduces non-linearity). Common functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh. |
| **Loss Function**     | Measures how well the model is performing.                            |
| **Optimizer**         | Algorithm (like **Gradient Descent**) that updates the weights to minimize loss. |

## 📊 Example: Image Classification with Neural Networks

| Input                  | Output                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Image pixels (features) | Label: **Cat** or **Dog**         |

The NN processes the pixel data through layers and predicts whether the image contains a **cat** or a **dog**.
