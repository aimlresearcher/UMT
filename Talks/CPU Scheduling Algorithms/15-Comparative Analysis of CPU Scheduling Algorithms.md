## 🧭 Choosing the Right Algorithm

| Scenario                           | Recommended Algorithm     | Reason                            |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Time-sharing system                | Round Robin               | Fairness + quick response         |
| Real-time task prioritization      | Preemptive Priority       | Urgent tasks go first             |
| Batch system with known burst times | SJF                      | Optimal turnaround time           |
| Mixed environment (interactive + batch) | MLFQ                   | Adaptive + fairness               |
| Diverse task types (system/user jobs) | Multilevel Queue         | Structured queue division         |
