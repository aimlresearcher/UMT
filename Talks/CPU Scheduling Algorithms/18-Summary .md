### 📋 Algorithm Recap

| Algorithm           | Type           | Highlight                                   |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| FCFS                | Non-Preemptive | Simple, but poor for response time          |
| SJF                 | Non-Preemptive | Best avg waiting time, risks starvation     |
| SRTF                | Preemptive     | Theoretically optimal, complex              |
| Priority Scheduling | Both           | Handles critical tasks, needs aging         |
| HRRN                | Non-Preemptive | Fair and balanced response time             |
| Round Robin         | Preemptive     | Great for time-sharing systems              |
| Multilevel Queue    | Hybrid         | Rigid category-based scheduling             |
| Multilevel Feedback | Hybrid         | Dynamic, adaptive, most realistic           |

### 📊 Performance Criteria Recap

| Metric         | Goal     | Description                           |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| CPU Utilization| Maximize | % time CPU is actively working        |
| Throughput     | Maximize | Processes completed per unit time     |
| Turnaround Time| Minimize | Total time from arrival to completion |
| Waiting Time   | Minimize | Time spent in ready queue             |
| Response Time  | Minimize | Time to first execution after arrival |

## 💬 11.2 Interactive Q&A

### ❓ Conceptual Questions

- Why does **SJF** give the **minimum average waiting time**?  
- What makes **SRTF** complex in **real systems**?  
- How does **Round Robin** ensure **fairness**?  
- What is **starvation** and how do we **prevent** it?  
- Why is **MLFQ** better suited for **general-purpose OS** than MLQ?

---

### ❓ Quick Numerical Review

**Given:**

- P1 (Arrival = 0, Burst = 4)  
- P2 (Arrival = 1, Burst = 3)  
- P3 (Arrival = 2, Burst = 1)  
- **Time Quantum = 2**

**Task:**

- Draw **Gantt chart** (Round Robin)  
- Calculate **average turnaround** and **waiting times**

## ✏️ Instructor Tips

- 🎤 Invite **student volunteers** to solve on the board  
- 📊 Use **polling or mini-quiz** (Kahoot, Google Forms)  
- ❓ Let students **ask questions** based on confusion from assignments or classwork

## ✅ Closing Note

> “There is no one-size-fits-all CPU scheduling algorithm.  
> The key is to understand the system’s needs—**speed**, **fairness**, **simplicity**, or **adaptability**—  
> and match the algorithm accordingly.”
