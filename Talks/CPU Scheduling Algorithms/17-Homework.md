### ✅ Assignment 1: Gantt Chart + Metrics Practice

**Instructions:**  
Given the following processes:

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| P1      | 0            | 6          |
| P2      | 2            | 3          |
| P3      | 4            | 4          |
| P4      | 6            | 2          |

**Tasks:**

- Apply **FCFS**, **SJF**, and **Round Robin (Q = 2)**  
- For each:
  - Draw the **Gantt Chart**
  - Calculate:
    - **Completion Time**
    - **Turnaround Time**
    - **Waiting Time**
    - **Response Time**
- Compare the results in a **summary table**  
- Write **5 sentences** summarizing the differences in performance

---

### ✅ Assignment 2: Code Implementation

**Language:** Python / C++ / Java (your choice)

**Tasks:**

- Implement **any two** of the following algorithms:
  - FCFS  
  - SJF (non-preemptive)  
  - SRTF (preemptive)  
  - Round Robin  
  - Preemptive Priority Scheduling

**Input:**

- Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, [Priority if needed]

**Output:**

- **Gantt chart-style display**  
- **Turnaround time** and **waiting time** per process  
- **Average turnaround** and **waiting time**

**Bonus:**  
- Track and display **context switches**

---

### ✅ Assignment 3: Scenario-Based Analysis

**Scenario:**  
You are designing a scheduling module for:

1. 💳 An ATM machine  
2. 🎮 A mobile game with smooth user experience  
3. 🏥 A hospital ICU monitoring system

**Tasks:**

- For each, recommend the **most suitable scheduling algorithm**  
- Justify your choice with **at least 3 technical reasons**  
- *(Optional)* Suggest **hybrid or custom scheduling improvements**

---

### ✅ Assignment 4: Research & Report

**Topic:** CPU Scheduling in Modern Operating Systems

**Instructions:**

- Research how scheduling is handled in **one** of the following:
  - Windows 10 or 11  
  - Linux (CFS Scheduler)  
  - Android or iOS  

**Write a 1-page report** answering:

1. What **algorithm(s)** are used?  
2. How is **fairness** and **priority** managed?  
3. How is **performance optimized**?

---

### ✅ Assignment 5: Creative Extension (Optional Bonus)

**Create:**  
A **Poster**, **Slide Deck**, or **Infographic** explaining **any one algorithm**

**Include:**

- 📌 Definition  
- 📊 Gantt chart example  
- ✅ Pros/❌ Cons  
- 🔍 Use case

**Tools:**  
Canva, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.

**Submission:**  
Upload to **LMS** or **present in next class**
