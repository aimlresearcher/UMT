## ✅ Key Elements in This Definition

- **"Perceive their environment"**  
  Links to the concept of agents and sensors (**PEAS**).

- **"Learn from experience"**  
  Implies **machine learning**, knowledge acquisition, and **adaptivity**.

- **"Make decisions or take actions"**  
  Relates to **problem solving**, **planning**, and **action**.

- **"Mimic or surpass human intelligence"**  
  Embraces both **human-like** and **rational** approaches.

## 🧠 Reflection Prompt
**What breakthrough do you think triggered the deep learning era?**

---

## 🚀 The Breakthrough: AlexNet (2012)
The deep learning era officially took off in **2012** when **AlexNet**, a deep convolutional neural network developed by **Alex Krizhevsky**, **Ilya Sutskever**, and **Geoffrey Hinton**, won the **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)** with a top-5 error rate of **15.3%**—**10 percentage points better** than the second-best entry.

## 👥 Group Discussion (10 mins)
### 🏥 Domain: Healthcare

### ✅ Three AI Applications:

1. **Medical Imaging Diagnosis**  
   - Uses deep learning (CNNs) to detect diseases like tumors or fractures from X-rays, MRIs, etc.

2. **Drug Discovery & Vaccine Development**  
   - AI accelerates the discovery of new compounds and predicts drug efficacy and interactions.

3. **Virtual Health Assistants & Chatbots**  
   - Offers 24/7 health advice and symptom checking.

  If training data lacks diversity, AI systems may underperform for certain demographics.

- **Data Privacy Concerns**  
  Sensitive health data must be securely stored, anonymized, and used ethically.

- **Decision Accountability**  
  Who is responsible if AI makes a wrong decision?  
  - The developer?  
  - The healthcare provider?  
  - The organization deploying the AI?

## ❓ What’s the Difference Between a Rational Agent and an Omniscient Agent?

| 🧠 **Concept**       | 📖 **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Omniscient Agent** | Knows the actual outcomes of all possible actions in advance (perfect foresight).  |
| **Rational Agent**   | Makes decisions that maximize expected performance based on current knowledge and percepts—not future certainty. |

---

### ✅ Key Difference:

A **rational agent** does **not know the future**, but makes the **best possible choice** with available information.

An **omniscient agent** knows **everything**, including the **true outcomes** of all actions—something that’s **unrealistic** in real-world AI.

---

### 💡 In short:

**Rational ≠ Perfect** — Rationality is about making the **best decision given what you know**, not being **all-knowing**.

## 🧠 PEAS Framework: AI Teacher Assistant

| **Element** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **P – Performance Measure** | - Student engagement  <br> - Accuracy in answering queries  <br> - Timely feedback  <br> - Learning improvement |
| **E – Environment** | - Classroom (physical or virtual)  <br> - Learning management systems (e.g., Moodle, Google Classroom)  <br> - Students and their interactions |
| **A – Actuators** | - Display screen  <br> - Text-to-speech output  <br> - Notification system  <br> - Email/Chat responses |
| **S – Sensors** | - Keyboard/mouse input  <br> - Microphone (for voice commands)  <br> - Student quiz data, behavior logs  <br> - Webcam (for emotion analysis in advanced systems) |

---

### 💡 Example Use:
A student asks: *“What’s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?”*  
→ The **AI assistant detects the question** (**Sensor**), **retrieves the correct concept** (using ML algorithms), and **responds clearly** on-screen or via audio (**Actuator**), while **logging performance** (**Performance Measure**) and **interaction context** (**Environment**).

---
## ❓ What’s the Key Difference Between Goal-Based and Utility-Based Agents?

| 🧠 **Agent Type**     | 📖 **Key Characteristic**               | 💡 **Decision Strategy**                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal-based Agent**   | Acts to achieve a specific goal          | Chooses actions that lead to any acceptable goal state     |
| **Utility-based Agent**| Acts to maximize a utility value         | Chooses the best action based on preferences or performance quality |

---

### ✅ Key Difference:

A **goal-based agent** checks:  
**“Does this action help me reach my goal?”**

A **utility-based agent** asks:  
**“Which action gets me the best result among all possible options?”**

---

### 🔍 In short:

- **Goal-based** = *Success vs. Failure*  
- **Utility-based** = *Better vs. Worse*

| (1) Automatic hand dryer         | Simple Reflex                 | Reacts to hand presence using a sensor; no memory or model of the world.       |
| (2) Waze navigation app          | Model-based + Goal-based      | Uses internal map/model of the environment and user goals (destination).       |
| (3) AI-based weather forecasting tool | Learning Agent            | Learns from past data and improves its predictions over time.                  |
