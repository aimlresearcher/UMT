## Question #2: CLO: 2 â€“ Design an Object-Oriented Model for a Real-World Problem

**Cognitive Level:** Creating  
**Marks:** 20

### Problem Statement:
Design a **Library Management System** for managing issued, returned, and overdue books (after 15 days), along with maintaining records of members and fine collection.

- Overdue Books:
  - **Executive members**: Rs. 50 per day fine
  - **Journal members**: Rs. 100 per day fine

- The librarian may send a **fine slip** to the memberâ€™s address.

- The system should provide:
  - An **easy-to-use interface for librarians** to manage books
  - A way for **members to search books** and **view their borrowing history**

## ðŸŽ“ Solution: Object-Oriented Model for Library Management System

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To design a class diagram that models a Library Management System with support for:
- Issuing, returning, and tracking overdue books
- Fine collection based on member type
- Member record management
- Librarian operations and fine slip generation
- Member search and borrowing history features

## ðŸ“˜ Class Diagram Design

### 1. Library
- `+books: List<Book>`
- `+members: List<Member>`
- `+issueBook(book: Book, member: Member): void`
- `+returnBook(book: Book, member: Member): void`
- `+checkOverdue(book: Book): int`
- `+sendFineSlip(member: Member): void`

### 2. Book
- `+title: string`
- `+author: string`
- `+ISBN: string`
- `+isIssued: bool`
- `+issueDate: Date`
- `+dueDate: Date`
- `+getOverdueDays(): int`

### 3. Member (Abstract)
- `+memberID: string`
- `+name: string`
- `+address: string`
- `+borrowedBooks: List<Book>`
- `+viewHistory(): void`
- `+calculateFine(daysLate: int): double` *(abstract)*

### 4. ExecutiveMember (inherits Member)
- `+calculateFine(daysLate: int): double` â†’ Returns `daysLate * 50`

### 5. JournalMember (inherits Member)
- `+calculateFine(daysLate: int): double` â†’ Returns `daysLate * 100`

### 6. Librarian
- `+name: string`
- `+manageBooks(): void`
- `+sendFineSlip(member: Member): void`

### 7. FineSlip
- `+member: Member`
- `+amount: double`
- `+issueDate: Date`
- `+generateSlip(): void`

### 8. SearchEngine
- `+searchBookByTitle(title: string): List<Book>`
- `+searchBookByAuthor(author: string): List<Book>`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Relationships
- `Library` aggregates `Book` and `Member`
- `Member` is an abstract class, implemented by `ExecutiveMember` and `JournalMember`
- `Library` uses `Librarian` for operations
- `FineSlip` is associated with `Member`
- `SearchEngine` is used by both `Member` and `Librarian`

---

## ðŸ’¡ System Behavior Summary
- When a book is issued, it is marked and assigned a `dueDate` (15 days from `issueDate`)
- If returned after `dueDate`, the system calculates fine:
  - `ExecutiveMember`: Rs. 50/day
  - `JournalMember`: Rs. 100/day
- `Librarian` can generate and send a `FineSlip` to member's address
- Members can:
  - Search for books
  - View borrowing history

---

## âœ… Design Highlights
- **Encapsulation**: Private data members like `balance`, `issueDate`, etc., accessed via methods
- **Abstraction**: Public methods hide internal logic like `calculateFine()` and `generateSlip()`
- **Inheritance**: `ExecutiveMember` and `JournalMember` inherit from `Member`
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden `calculateFine()` methods provide specific fine logic based on member type
