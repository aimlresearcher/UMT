# ðŸ“Œ Internal View vs External View in Functions

---

| Perspective              | Focus |
|---------------------------|-------|
| **Internal View (Developer)** | How the function works internally (its logic, body, implementation) |
| **External View (User)**      | What the function does (its purpose, behavior during function call) |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Internal View (Developerâ€™s Perspective)

- **Who?** âž” The programmer writing the function.
- **Focus?** âž” **HOW** the task is done:
  - Detailed logic
  - Variables
  - Loops
  - Conditions

### Example:

Inside the function, you carefully write how to calculate something step-by-step.

```cpp
// Developer's internal view
int square(int num) {
    int result = num * num;   // How the squaring is done
    return result;
}
```
Here, the internal view focuses on the multiplication logic inside the function.

---

## ðŸ”¹ External View (Userâ€™s Perspective)

- **Who?** âž” The person calling or using the function.
- **Focus?** âž” **WHAT** the function does:
  - Takes an input
  - Returns a squared value
  - Does not care how multiplication happens inside

### Example:
```cpp
// User's external view
int answer = square(5); // Just call and expect the square of 5
cout << "Square is: " << answer;
```
The user just knows:

> "If I give 5 to `square()`, it will return 25."

The user does **NOT** care how multiplication or calculation is done internally.

# ðŸ”¥ Why Is This Important? (Relation to Abstraction)

- **Abstraction** means hiding details and showing only essentials.
- This separation (**internal vs external view**) is at the heart of abstraction:
  - Hide messy internal logic
  - Expose a clean, simple function interface

---

## Result:

âž” Users can easily use functions without knowing their complexity.  
âž” Developers can improve internal working without affecting users.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Simple Real-Life Analogy:

Think of a **TV remote**:

- You (user) press a button (**external view**) and the TV changes channels.
- Inside the remote (**internal view**), complex circuits work â€” but you don't need to know about them!

# âœ… Final Summary

| Internal View | External View |
|---------------|---------------|
| Focuses on how the function works (code inside) | Focuses on what the function does (input/output) |
| Written by developers | Used by function callers/users |
| Important for function implementation | Important for function usability |
